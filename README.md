# Food Order App

_<div align="right">2021.12.16 Hunimoda</div>_

-   What is this app?

This app is a clone application copied from a course in Udemy: **React - The Complete Guide** _by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller_. The code is different from the original version by Max because I copied only the design but not the source code. So it may not be the best implementation but the code works fine anyway.

-   What does the app do?

It's a dummy app that can order food. You can add anything by any amount from the menu, then it will be added to the cart. The cart shows what you've added, and you can change the amount as the modal pops up. Of course you can neither order the food nor send the info to anywhere else since the app only implements the front.

- Things to be fixed

  - Enhance reusability of modal by using props.children
  - Use portal in modal for better structure
  - Separate the context managing logic in a different file
